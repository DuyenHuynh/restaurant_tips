# Restaurant tips analysis
## 1. Introduction
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

We can see information about:

the day it occurred
if it was at lunch or dinner
the total bill
the sex of the person
if they were a smoker or not
the size of the party

## 3. Goals:
Let's figure out the difference between smokers and non-smokers in terms of their behavior and purchasing habits in public catering establishments.
